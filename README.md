Welcome to the openOS wiki! A Project from Thomas Lamprecht. It has been initiated as a research project for my mature exam I'm going to made next year on the "Gewerbe Oberschule Bruneck"

# Releases

openOS isn't really the name of the project. Since developing started we've given fruit names as Code-names in alphabetical order to the 'releases'.
Code-names 'til yet:

* Apple
* Banana
* Cranberry

# Build
execute `make` in the kernel directory to build the kernel.

The builded kernel, in elf format, could be executed in qemu like this:

`qemu -kernel kernel`
